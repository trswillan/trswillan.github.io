    <h1>This is Willa's Website!</h1>
    <p> Hi! My name is Willa and I am so proud of this website. I love to learn and my hobbies include soccer, acting, singing, volunteering, swimming and reading.</p>
    <h3>My Goals:</h3>
    <p> My goal for this year was to increase my vocabulary and qualitiy of analysis, and has been very similar to my stretch. The steps I have taken to achieve this goal have been subscribing to Dictionary.com's Word of the Day and I have been incorporating this new vocab into the class debates and my writing. Addtionally, I have written down key words from all of my reading. Now, when I am analyzing in my annotations or note-taking, I try to take every opportunity to use these words. A good example of my increase in analysis would be my Book 5 and 6 Q&As. </p>
      <h3>
      My Stretch:
      </h3>
      <p>
      My stretch for this year was to increase my vocabulary so I can sound more eloquent and be able to get my point across simply. The way I planned on achieving this was to keep track of vocabulary words I didn't know, create flashcards and occasionally test myself. So far, I have been keeping good track ina few different notebooks and I have been reading from different genres, so my growth has been large. This is still relevant to be my stretch.</p>
      <h3>
      My Strengths:
      </h3>
      <p> One of my strengths is using my ability to learn visually and channeling that in my presentations and projects. An example is when I made a presentation on an organization called FFCC and I was able to set up a Thanksgiving Food Box Project. We collected over 20 bags of complete meals for a group of homeless women and their children.
