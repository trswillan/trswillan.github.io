    <p> This is an image of my Odyssey Notebook and my Book 5 and 6 Q&As. Inside I have my notes for each book, my plot summaries, my quote annotations, my comprehension checks and any additional pages. The Q&As have several pages of self made questions and analysis.
</p>
      <p> I decided to include these artifacts because it is the most concrete example of how I have taken both analysis and vocabulary into consideration. Also, I have spent the most time on these assignments. These pieces are an example of my strength because I included illustrations in every plot summary, which helps me visualize the story. They are an example of my stretch and goal because I have a vocabulary column in my notes and I was forced to take new perspectives in my Q&As analysis. This artifact represents my Striving for Accuracy and Precision Habits of Mind.
