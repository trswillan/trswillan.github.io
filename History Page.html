<p> This is an image of my Give Me Liberty Notebook. Inside there is nearly 150 pages worth of annotations about Key Concepts, Important Events/People and Big Questions.</p>
	<p>I decided to include this artifact because I think it exemplifies my greatest amount of growth in this class. The first image shows the quality of work I was producing at first but the second shows my work now. Looking closely, it is easy to say that the amount of analysis has increased greatly and I am understanding and pulling more from the readings every week. It is an example of my strength because many of my annotations include charts or pictures to go along with Key Concepts. It is an example of my stretch and goal because as I’ve gone along, I have done greater amounts of Word Gaps, such as “encroachment” and “porous”. </p>
