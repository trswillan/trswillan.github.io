    <p> This is an image of my 3rd test of the year, which I received a 99% on.</p>
      <p>I decided to include this artifact because it is the biggest example of growth pertaining to my strength, strech and goal in math. This piece is an example of my strength because I can easily figure out problems when they are drawn out, like a mathematic map. This is an example of my stretch and goal because a majority of the tests was about identifying shapes and what the correct terminology was. This helped me expand in yet another subject. This is an example of the Striving for Accuracy and Precision Habits of Mind.</p>
