Mid-Year Reflection Questions and Responses:
</h1>  


<ol>
      <li> My friend group is very broad, as I am friends with the majority of kids in my grade. I do have two very close friends, Mele and Kelly, but they don't interfere with my relationships with others at all. I have tried to do new things, like basketball, in order to broaden my friend group even further.
</li>
      <li>I applied for Student Body President. I have taken the charge on several charity events, including the Thanksgiving Box Project Drive. I have also started the Student Council this year with Kait Podlich and Zara Bannister, who I have gotten closer to. These projects challenged me as a leader because it was much more responsibility than I had ever taken on. In the future, I think it would be even better if I had more collaboration on ideas, which would get more people invovled and help me grow.
</li>
      <li>I am always consistent on completing my work on time. I have a calendar that maps out all of my extracurricular and it helps me plan out the times I can work on my homework and projects. 
</li>
