<p> Theatre helps me be an organized person. Every time I am given a script, I have to not only memorize my lines but think deeply on how to portray my character. This influences me as a student because I expands my tool box for analyzing how the characters in my Literature classes are feeling. This is also why I am particularly excited to do Shakespear this year. </p>
