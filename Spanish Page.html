    <p>	This is an image of my “Cuando Yo Era Pequeña Creía Que..." writing project. It is a piece over 150 words long about things I used to believe when I was little.

     <p>I decided to include this because it was the first time in Spanish where I was able to write a piece alone and have less than 10 corrections on my 1st draft. Spanish is a subject that I sometimes struggle in so I was very proud of this assignment. This relates to my strength because I was writing about something I could visualize in my mind, so my organization was really good. This was a part of my stretch and goal because I had a dictionary with me and by the end I expanded my Spanish vocabulary on subjects like magic and toys. This is a representation of Thinking Flexibly and Learning Continously, as I used many resources to create this project. This is an example of Thinking Flexibly, as I have to be creative for every new annotation.</p>
